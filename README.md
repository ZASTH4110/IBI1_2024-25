Hello! I’m Hao Ziteng, an IBI1 student at the Zhejiang University - University of Edinburgh (ZJE) Institute. 
I have a broad range of interests, including reading, watching documentaries, and exploring new ideas through discussion. 
I also enjoy sports like football, which help me stay active and build team spirit. 
During my time at ZJE, I’ve taken part in several student activities and group projects that have helped me grow in communication, collaboration, and critical thinking. 
I believe learning is a journey best shared with others, and I look forward to making progress together with my teachers and peers in the coming year!
