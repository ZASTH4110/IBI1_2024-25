During this course, I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems and how to write simple programs in Python.
I meet question when I use the "git merge" because I don't know what changed when I merge the branch to the master
I also find that in my window systems. The "master" is called "main".
I gradually know how to use the git and GitHub.I really enjoy this process.
I have mastered the advantages and basic operations of version control.
I'm looking forward to the next IBI lecture.
